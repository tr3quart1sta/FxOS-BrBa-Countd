 * In this file you can add everything that your web app handles. As example we

 * prints "Button has been pressed" on the console. Of course, it could be whatever you'd
 * like to do.
 *
 * The code between
 *
 * (function () {
 *
 * and
 *
 * })();
 *
 * is called when the app starts or the content is reloaded. If you need to do something
 * as soon as the app starts you should do it here.
